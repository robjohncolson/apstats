The important information and key concepts for teaching **Unit 2, Topic 2.5: Correlation** are focused on defining, calculating, and interpreting the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two quantitative variables.

This topic is part of Unit 2: Exploring Two-Variable Data, which accounts for 5–7% of the multiple-choice section of the AP Exam. The enduring understanding for this topic is **DAT-1: Regression models may allow us to predict responses to changes in an explanatory variable**.

Here is the essential information to teach for Unit 2, Topic 2.5:

### Core Content: Correlation

The central element of this topic is understanding the **correlation coefficient, *r***:

1.  **Definition and Quantification:** The correlation, *r*, is the measure that **gives the direction and quantifies the strength of the linear association** between two quantitative variables.
2.  **Calculation (Skill 2.C):** Students must be able to determine the correlation for a linear relationship. While the formula for *r* is available, the most common way to determine *r* is by **using technology**.
3.  **Properties of *r***:
    *   The correlation coefficient, *r*, is **unit-free**.
    *   The value of *r* always lies between **−1 and 1**, inclusive.
    *   A value of ***r* = 0** indicates that there is **no linear association**.
    *   A value of ***r* = 1 or *r* = −1** indicates that there is a **perfect linear association**.
    *   A correlation coefficient close to 1 or −1, however, **does not necessarily mean that a linear model is appropriate**.
4.  **Interpretation (Skill 4.B):** Students must be able to interpret the correlation for a linear relationship.

### Key Warning: Correlation vs. Causation

A crucial teaching point tied directly to this topic is the distinction between correlation and causation (Essential Knowledge DAT-1.C.2).

*   A perceived or real relationship between two variables **does not mean that changes in one variable cause changes in the other**. That is, **correlation does not necessarily imply causation**.

As an educator, you should highlight discussions surrounding this concept, perhaps using a thought-provoking essential question for the unit, such as: "Does the fact that the number of shark attacks increases with ice cream sales necessarily mean that ice cream sales cause shark attacks?".

### Skills Development Focus

Topic 2.5 is paired with two critical skills:

1.  **Data Analysis (Skill 2.C):** Students should be able to **calculate** summary statistics, including correlation.
2.  **Statistical Argumentation (Skill 4.B):** Students need to **interpret** statistical calculations and findings to assign meaning or assess a claim.

To help students master these interpretation skills, the sources suggest activities like the **Quickwrite**, where students are given a scatterplot and computer output, then asked to identify and describe the meaning of values like the correlation in the context of the problem. Students should also practice translating output from technology ("calculator speak") into appropriate statistical language, making sure to connect their numerical results to the scenario’s context.

For instance, when explaining evidence of a linear relationship, students must be careful to reserve the word "**correlation**" specifically for discussions about relationships between **two quantitative variables**.

To emphasize the distinction between correlation and causation: Imagine finding a strong positive correlation between the number of umbrellas sold in a city and the number of traffic accidents reported. The correlation is strong, but selling more umbrellas doesn't *cause* more accidents. Instead, both are caused by a third variable—rain. Teaching this distinction is key to ensuring students draw sound, non-deterministic conclusions from data.
