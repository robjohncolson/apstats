Timestamp,Slide Description
00:00-00:09,"Title Slide:  The title is ""Topic 2.5: Distinguish Between Correlation and Causation."""
00:10-00:23,"Learning Objectives:  The slide lists what will be learned: ""What is the difference between correlation and causation?"", ""How do we factor in alternative explanations into our data analyses?"", and ""What kinds of inferences can we make from data that show strong correlations?"""
00:24-01:05,"Example: The Achievement Gap:  This slide introduces an example of the achievement gap, noting that high and middle-income students tend to perform better on math exams than low-income students nationally. It shows a chart illustrating that these gaps have been consistent over multiple years in the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) data. The slide notes that this data is a ""trend of averages"" and says ""nothing about innate intelligence."""
01:06-02:08,"The Policy Question: Can Schools Close the Gap?  This slide discusses the idea of schools equalizing opportunities. It introduces the ""attendance gap,"" noting that higher-income areas have fewer chronically absent students, and lists possible explanations (transit, need to work). It then presents a hypothesized chain of causality: ""Poverty causes Low Attendance"" $\rightarrow$ ""Low Attendance causes Low Test Scores."" The question is posed: if initiatives fix attendance, will test scores rise, leading to more equal opportunity?"
02:09-02:19,Is that Idea Reasonable or BS?  This is a transitional slide setting up the analysis of the causal claim.
02:20-02:44,"Data Shows Strong Correlation:  This slide shows a scatter plot from a previous video, illustrating a strong, positive, linear relationship between the percent of school days students attend and their math test scores. It confirms that this trend is seen in data sets with thousands of students."
02:45-03:17,"Pilot Programs Fix Attendance, but Test Scores Stay Flat:  This slide describes the results of large-scale programs (calling absent students, hiring case managers, using ride-share apps) that successfully increased attendance but resulted in test scores staying flat. The question is posed: ""How could that be possible? What happened?"""
03:18-04:26,"An Alternative Explanation: Poverty as the True Causal Variable:  This slide presents an alternative model. It suggests that poverty causes low attendance, but also causes other things like ""hunger,"" ""worse schools,"" and ""less study time"" due to working or family care. The conclusion is that these other variables are the ""true causes of low test scores"" and that fixing attendance alone did not address the true chain of causation."
04:27-05:08,"Correlation $\neq$ Causation:  This fundamental slide emphasizes the core concept: ""Correlation does not equal causation."" It argues that attendance and test performance may correlate strongly, but a direct causal relationship may not exist. The other variables (hunger, school quality, study time) may be the actual causal factors, and high attendance may simply ""coincide with other variables that carry high causal advantage."""
05:09-05:29,"Identifying True Causal Mechanisms:  The slide discusses the challenge of identifying the true causal mechanisms to fight educational inequity and mentions that ""Causal Inference is coming soon"" in Unit 3."
05:30-06:10,"Causation Fallacies: Coincidental Correlations:  This slide introduces the idea of coincidental correlations. It presents a graph showing a very strong positive correlation between ""Divorce rate in Maine"" and ""Per capita consumption of Margarin (US)"" over time, concluding that this is, of course, ""coincidental."""
06:11-07:05,"What Should We Take Away for Today?  The final slide summarizes the main takeaways: ""Correlation does not equal causation,"" and ""Beware of other variables or coincidental correlations."" The speaker then encourages the audience to ""think about what you can do to investigate and ultimately fight educational inequity."" The video closes with the phrase: ""Be critical, be cautious, be compassionate, and avoid BS."""
