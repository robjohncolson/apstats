1,"When studying if one variable might predict another, the predictor variable is called:",Explanatory variable,Response variable,Dependent variable,Correlation variable,30,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"The variable we think might be influenced or predicted goes on which axis?",X-axis (horizontal),Y-axis (vertical),Either axis works equally,The axis with larger range,30,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,"What type of data requires a scatter plot for visualization?",Two quantitative variables,Two categorical variables,One quantitative and one categorical,Three or more variables,30,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,"Each point on a scatter plot represents:",One individual's pair of measurements,An average of multiple observations,The most frequent value pair,A predicted relationship,30,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,"When data shows a pattern between two variables, we can conclude:",A relationship might exist,One definitely causes the other,The variables are independent,The data is biased,30,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6,"'Correlation does not imply causation' means:",Patterns don't prove one variable causes another,Correlations are always coincidental,Causation never creates correlation,Statistical patterns are meaningless,30,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7,"A properly constructed scatter plot must include all EXCEPT:",Title describing the context,Labeled axes with units,Appropriately scaled tick marks,A trend line through points,30,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,"The explanatory variable is also commonly known as:",Independent variable,Dependent variable,Output variable,Result variable,30,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,"Bivariate data means:",Data measuring two variables,Data with two possible outcomes,Data from two time periods,Data with binary responses,30,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,"When would a scatter plot be inappropriate?",Comparing categories to numbers,Comparing two measurements,Looking for patterns between quantities,Examining paired numerical data,30,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,"If studying whether practice time affects performance, practice time is the:",Explanatory variable,Response variable,Confounding variable,Categorical variable,30,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,"Group average trends in data:",May not apply to individuals,Always predict individual outcomes,Prove causal relationships,Eliminate all variation,30,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,"The response variable in a study is the one we:",Try to predict or explain,Use to make predictions,Control in the experiment,Measure most accurately,30,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,"What makes a variable quantitative?",It has numerical meaning and order,It fits into distinct categories,It has exactly two values,It's measured precisely,30,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
15,"Hidden factors affecting both variables in a study are called:",Confounding variables,Response variables,Explanatory variables,Categorical variables,30,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16,"When axis scales don't start at zero, they should:",Clearly show the data range,Always be marked as misleading,Never be used in statistics,Start at the minimum value,30,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
17,"Switching which variable is explanatory changes:",Which axis each variable uses,The actual data values,The strength of relationship,Whether correlation exists,30,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
18,"A scatter plot is specifically designed to show:",Relationships between two quantities,Comparisons between groups,Changes over time periods,Distribution of one variable,30,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,"Statistical conclusions should be all EXCEPT:",Certain about causation,Critical of claims,Cautious with interpretation,Compassionate with context,30,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,"Two variables showing no pattern in a scatter plot suggests:",No linear relationship exists,Perfect negative correlation,Strong causal connection,Measurement error occurred,30,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,"The term 'on average' in statistics emphasizes:",Individual variation exists within groups,All individuals follow the pattern,The median equals the mean,Data has no outliers,30,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
22,"Which best describes the purpose of identifying explanatory and response variables?",To clarify our hypothesis about relationships,To prove causation between variables,To determine correlation strength,To eliminate confounding factors,30,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,"A researcher can choose which variable is explanatory based on:",The research question being asked,Which has larger values,Which is easier to measure,Mathematical requirements,30,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,"Observational data showing correlation between variables:",Cannot prove causation without experimentation,Always indicates direct causation,Proves reverse causation exists,Eliminates all other explanations,30,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,"Good statistical thinking requires being skeptical of:",Oversimplified causal claims,All data patterns,Mathematical calculations,Visual representations,30,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
