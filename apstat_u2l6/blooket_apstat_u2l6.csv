Question #,Question Text,Answer 1,Answer 2,Answer 3,Answer 4,Time Limit (sec),Correct Answer(s)
1,What does the correlation coefficient r measure?,Direction and strength of linear relationship,Only the strength of a relationship,The causation between variables,The percentage of data explained,15,1
2,What is the range of possible values for the correlation coefficient r?,-1 to 1 inclusive,0 to 1,-? to ?,0 to 100,15,1
3,"If r = 0.95, what does this indicate about the relationship?",Very strong positive linear relationship,Very weak positive relationship,Very strong negative relationship,No relationship,15,1
4,What does a negative correlation coefficient indicate?,"As X increases, Y tends to decrease","As X increases, Y tends to increase",There is no relationship,The data has errors,15,1
5,"If r = 0, what can we conclude?",No linear relationship exists,No relationship exists at all,Perfect negative correlation,The variables are identical,20,1
6,Which correlation value indicates the strongest linear relationship?,r = -0.92,r = 0.75,r = 0.10,r = -0.45,15,1
7,What is true about the correlation coefficient r?,It is unit-free,It has units of X/Y,It has units of Y/X,It has units of X times Y,15,1
8,A tennis ball's height vs time has r = 0. What does this suggest?,No linear relationship (likely quadratic),No relationship at all,Perfect linear relationship,Measurement error occurred,20,1
9,"If r = 1, what type of relationship exists?",Perfect positive linear relationship,Strong but not perfect relationship,No relationship,Perfect negative linear relationship,15,1
10,Which r value indicates a moderate positive correlation?,r = 0.5,r = 0.95,r = -0.5,r = 0.05,15,1
11,True or False: Correlation implies causation.,False,True,Sometimes,Only for r > 0.8,15,1
12,What crucial distinction did the attendance example demonstrate?,Correlation does not imply causation,Strong correlations always predict outcomes,Attendance causes better test scores,Small samples give unreliable correlations,20,1
13,"If more ice cream sales correlate with more shark attacks, what's likely the reason?",A third variable (summer/warm weather),Ice cream causes shark attacks,Sharks cause ice cream sales,The correlation is false,20,1
14,School districts raised attendance but test scores stayed flat. This shows:,Correlation doesn't guarantee causation,The correlation was calculated wrong,Attendance doesn't matter,Test scores are random,20,1
15,What might explain a correlation without causation?,Lurking or confounding variables,Calculation errors,Small sample size,Negative relationships,15,1
16,"To determine if a linear model is appropriate, you must:",Look at the scatterplot,Only check if r is close to 1,Calculate r squared,Find the regression line,20,1
17,A correlation of r = 0.94 between leaf length and area means:,Strong linear association but not necessarily best model,Linear model is definitely the best fit,94% of the data fits perfectly,Exponential model is better,20,1
18,What can correlation alone NOT tell us about data?,Unusual features or outliers,Direction of relationship,Strength of linear relationship,Sign of relationship,20,1
19,Which is closest to r for strong negative correlation?,r = -0.87,r = -0.14,r = 0.87,r = 0,15,1
20,How is correlation typically calculated?,Using technology/calculator,By hand using the formula,By counting data points,By visual estimation only,15,1
21,"If athletes who exercise more have lower resting heart rates, r is likely:",Negative and strong,Positive and strong,Zero,Positive and weak,20,1
22,What does the magnitude (absolute value) of r tell us?,Strength of linear relationship,Direction of relationship,Causation level,Number of data points,15,1
23,Restaurant data shows r = 0.78 between party size and time. This means:,Larger parties tend to stay longer,Larger parties leave quicker,No relationship exists,Party size causes longer stays,20,1
24,"For the attendance study, what was the correlation value?",0.95,0.50,-0.95,0,15,1
25,"When r is closer to zero, the linear relationship is:",Weaker,Stronger,Perfect,Negative,15,1
26,What property makes r useful for comparing different datasets?,It is unit-free,It has standard units,It's always positive,It equals the slope,20,1
27,"If two variables have r = -1, their relationship is:",Perfect negative linear,No relationship,Perfect positive linear,Moderately negative,15,1
28,Why might a strong correlation not lead to successful interventions?,Confounding variables affect both,Correlations are always wrong,Interventions change correlations,Sample size was too small,20,1
