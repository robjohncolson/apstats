Unit 2: Exploring Two-Variable Data
Topic 2.6: Linear Regression Models
SKILL
Data Analysis (2.C): Calculate summary statistics, relative positions of points within a distribution, correlation, and predicted response.
REQUIRED COURSE CONTENT
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
DAT-1: Regression models may allow us to predict responses to changes in an explanatory variable.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
DAT-1.D: Calculate a predicted response value using a linear regression model. [Skill 2.C]
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
DAT-1.D.1: A simple linear regression model is an equation that uses an explanatory variable, x, to predict the response variable, y.
DAT-1.D.2: The predicted response value, denoted by ŷ, is calculated as ŷ = a + bx, where a is the y-intercept and b is the slope of the regression line, and x is the value of the explanatory variable.
DAT-1.D.3: Extrapolation is predicting a response value using a value for the explanatory variable that is beyond the interval of x-values used to determine the regression line. The predicted value is less reliable as an estimate the further we extrapolate.
