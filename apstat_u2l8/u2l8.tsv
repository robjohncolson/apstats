(Only include Answer #)"
1	Why does the least squares regression line minimize the sum of squared residuals rather than the sum of absolute residuals?	Squaring eliminates negative values and has desirable mathematical properties for calculus	Absolute values are too difficult to calculate without modern computing technology	Squared residuals always produce a line through the origin of the coordinate system	The sum of absolute residuals would give equal weight to all data points	20	1
2	"When comparing two linear models for the same dataset, Model A has a sum of residuals of 0 and Model B has a sum of residuals of 0. What can we conclude?"	Both models are equally good fits because their residual sums are identical	Neither conclusion is valid without examining the squared residuals instead	Model A must be better because it was mentioned first in the comparison	The models are identical lines because only one line has zero residual sum	20	2
3	"For three perfectly collinear points, why might a poorly fitting line still have a sum of residuals equal to zero?"	Positive and negative residuals can cancel each other out algebraically	Collinear points automatically produce zero residuals for any fitted line	The calculation method for residuals changes when points are collinear	Three points always define a unique line with zero total deviation	20	1
4	The least squares regression line for a dataset always passes through which point?	The point with coordinates (x̄, ȳ) where bars indicate means	The first data point that was collected in the original sample	The median values of both the explanatory and response variables	The point that minimizes the distance to all other data points	15	1
5	"If a dataset has x̄ = 42.5 and ȳ = 18.3, which point must lie on the LSRL?"	"(42.5, 18.3) because the regression line contains the mean point"	"(18.3, 42.5) because the coordinates can be reversed for linearity"	"(30.4, 30.4) because this represents the average of both means"	"(0, 60.8) because this is the y-intercept plus both means"	15	1
6	What does minimizing the sum of squared residuals accomplish in regression analysis?	It finds the line that best balances prediction errors across all data points	It ensures that exactly half of the residuals will be positive values	It guarantees that the correlation coefficient will be maximized	It forces the regression line to pass through every data point	20	1
7	"Two students fit lines to the same data. Student A's line has Σ(residuals)² = 145. Student B's line has Σ(residuals)² = 132. Which is the better model?"	Student B's model because it has the smaller sum of squared residuals	Student A's model because larger squared residuals indicate stronger fit	Neither model is better without knowing the correlation coefficient	Both models are equivalent since they use the same dataset	15	1
8	"Given correlation r = 0.8, sy = 12, and sx = 4, what is the slope of the LSRL?"	b = 2.4 because slope equals correlation times ratio of standard deviations	b = 0.267 because slope equals correlation divided by ratio of standard deviations	b = 3.75 because slope equals sum of standard deviations times correlation	b = 38.4 because slope equals product of all three given values	20	1
9	"If the LSRL equation is ŷ = 15 + 3x, what is the predicted change in y when x increases by 2 units?"	The predicted y value increases by 6 units based on the slope coefficient	The predicted y value increases by 21 units including the intercept effect	The predicted y value increases by 3 units regardless of the change in x	The predicted y value increases by 30 units after doubling all terms	20	1
10	"For the regression equation ŷ = -8.5 + 1.2x predicting test scores from hours studied, interpret the slope."	Each additional hour studied predicts an average 1.2 point increase in score	Students who don't study are predicted to score negative 8.5 points	The correlation between hours studied and test score equals 1.2	Test scores increase by 8.5 points for every 1.2 hours studied	15	1
11	When is the y-intercept of a regression line meaningful in context?	When the explanatory variable can reasonably take the value zero	When the response variable has only positive values in the dataset	When the correlation coefficient is greater than 0.7 in magnitude	When all data points are located in the first quadrant only	15	1
12	"A regression predicting weight from height has y-intercept -200 pounds. Why is this not meaningful?"	A height of zero inches is not realistic for the context being studied	Negative weights are impossible indicating an error in calculation	The y-intercept should always be positive in biological contexts	The regression line must pass through the origin for height-weight data	20	1
13	"If correlation r = -0.6 and the ratio sy/sx = 5, what is the slope of the LSRL?"	b = -3.0 because slope equals correlation times the ratio of standard deviations	b = -0.12 because slope equals correlation divided by the ratio of standard deviations	b = 3.0 because slope magnitude ignores the sign of the correlation	b = -8.33 because slope equals the ratio divided by correlation	20	1
14	"The LSRL for predicting final exam score from homework average is ŷ = 45 + 0.5x. If homework average is 80, what is the predicted exam score?"	85 points as calculated by substituting the homework value into the equation	125.5 points by adding all numerical values in the problem together	40 points representing half of the homework average as indicated by slope	45.5 points by adding the slope to the intercept value directly	20	1
15	"If the correlation between two variables is r = 0.9, what is R²?"	0.81 because the coefficient of determination equals correlation squared	0.95 because the coefficient of determination equals square root of correlation	0.90 because the coefficient of determination equals the correlation itself	1.81 because the coefficient of determination equals correlation plus itself	15	1
16	An R² value of 0.64 means what percentage of variation in y is explained by the linear relationship with x?	64% of the variation in the response variable is explained by the model	36% of the variation in the response variable is explained by the model	80% of the variation in the response variable is explained by the model	8% of the variation in the response variable is explained by the model	15	1
17	"If R² = 0.49, what are the possible values for the correlation r?"	r = 0.7 or r = -0.7 because correlation is the square root of R²	r = 0.49 only because correlation and R² are the same value	r = 0.24 or r = -0.24 because correlation is half of R²	r = 0.7 only because correlation cannot be negative with positive R²	20	1
18	"What does it mean when comparing a 'mean model' to the LSRL for calculating R²?"	The mean model predicts ȳ for all values while LSRL uses x to predict	The mean model uses the median while LSRL uses the average of all points	The mean model includes all variables while LSRL uses only significant ones	The mean model weights observations equally while LSRL weights by distance	20	1
19	"A regression has R² = 0.15. What does this suggest about the linear relationship?"	The linear relationship is weak with most variation unexplained by the model	The linear relationship is strong but the data has high natural variability	The calculation is incorrect because R² must be at least 0.50	The variables have no relationship because R² is less than one	15	1
20	How is R² related to the reduction in sum of squared residuals?	R² represents the percent reduction from the mean model to the LSRL model	R² represents the absolute reduction in residuals between any two models	R² represents the ratio of residuals to the total number of observations	R² represents the sum of all positive residuals in the final model	20	1
21	"In computer output for regression, where is the slope coefficient typically found?"	As the coefficient of the explanatory variable in the regression table	As the constant or intercept term in the regression table	As the R² value in the model summary statistics section	As the standard error of the regression in the output	15	1
22	"Computer output shows: Constant = 25.3, StudyHours coefficient = 4.2, R² = 0.72. What is the regression equation?"	ŷ = 25.3 + 4.2x where x represents study hours	ŷ = 4.2 + 25.3x where x represents study hours	ŷ = 0.72 + 29.5x combining all numerical values	ŷ = 72 + 25.3x using percentage form of R²	20	1
23	"If computer output shows a negative slope coefficient and R² = 0.36, what is the correlation?"	r = -0.6 because the negative slope indicates negative correlation	r = 0.6 because correlation is always positive when calculated	r = -0.36 because correlation equals R² with the slope's sign	r = -0.13 because correlation is R² divided by slope coefficient	20	1
24	"A regression of price on square footage shows: Intercept = 50000, Slope = 125, R² = 0.85. Interpret the slope."	Each additional square foot predicts an average price increase of $125	Houses with no square footage are predicted to cost $50000	The correlation between square footage and price equals 0.85	Square footage explains $125 worth of price variation	15	1
25	"When reading computer output, how can you determine if the correlation is positive or negative?"	Check the sign of the slope coefficient for the explanatory variable	Check whether R² is greater than or less than 0.5	Check the sign of the intercept term in the regression equation	Check whether the standard error is positive or negative	15	1
