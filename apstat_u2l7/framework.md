Topic 2.7: Residuals
SKILLS
Data Analysis (2.B): Construct numerical or graphical representations of distributions.
Data Analysis (2.A): Describe data presented numerically or graphically.
ENDURING UNDERSTANDING
DAT-1: Regression models may allow us to predict responses to changes in an explanatory variable.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES & ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
DAT-1.E: Represent differences between measured and predicted responses using residual plots. [Skill 2.B]
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
DAT-1.E.1: The residual is the difference between the actual value and the predicted value: residual = y − ŷ.
DAT-1.E.2: A residual plot is a plot of residuals versus explanatory variable values or predicted response values.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE
DAT-1.F: Describe the form of association of bivariate data using residual plots. [Skill 2.A]
ESSENTIAL KNOWLEDGE
DAT-1.F.1: Apparent randomness in a residual plot for a linear model is evidence of a linear form to the association between the variables.
DAT-1.F.2: Residual plots can be used to investigate the appropriateness of a selected model.
