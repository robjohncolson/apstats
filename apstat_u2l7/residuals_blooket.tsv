1	A regression line has equation ŷ = 3.2x + 15.7. When x = 10, the actual value is y = 50. The residual for this point is:	The difference 50 minus 47.7 equals 2.3 units	The difference 47.7 minus 50 equals negative 2.3 units	The difference 50 minus 32 equals 18 units	The difference 32 minus 50 equals negative 18 units	20	1
2	A positive residual of 12.5 indicates that:	The predicted value exceeded the actual value by 12.5 units	The actual value exceeded the predicted value by 12.5 units	The model's slope increased by a factor of 12.5 units	The correlation coefficient increased by a value of 12.5	15	2
3	In a residual plot showing good linear model fit, you would expect to observe:	A clear upward trend from left to right across the plot	A distinct curved pattern throughout the range of x-values	Random scatter of points centered around the zero line	All residual values positioned above the horizontal axis	15	3
4	A residual plot displays a U-shaped pattern. This suggests that:	The linear model appropriately captures the relationship between variables	A nonlinear model might better describe the relationship between variables	The residuals demonstrate constant variance across all x-values	The correlation coefficient is very close to negative one	20	2
5	When calculating a residual, the formula y - ŷ represents:	The predicted value minus the observed value of the response	The observed value minus the predicted value of the response	The explanatory value minus the predicted value of the response	The slope value minus the intercept value of the model	15	2
6	A store's income level predicts 85 organic items, but it actually offers 72. The residual is:	Positive thirteen, indicating the model underestimated the actual value	Negative thirteen, indicating the model overestimated the actual value	Positive thirteen, indicating the model overestimated the actual value	Negative thirteen, indicating the model underestimated the actual value	20	2
7	The primary purpose of constructing a residual plot is to:	Calculate the correlation coefficient for the dataset more accurately	Determine the exact values of slope and intercept parameters	Assess whether the linear model appropriately fits the data	Identify which data points have the largest y-values	15	3
8	In a residual plot, the horizontal reference line is positioned at:	The mean value of all observed response variables	The value zero on the vertical residual axis	The median value of all calculated residual values	The value one on the vertical residual axis	15	2
9	A residual value of exactly zero indicates that:	The linear model perfectly fits all data points simultaneously	The predicted value equals the actual value for that point	The correlation coefficient equals zero for the entire dataset	The data point should be removed from the analysis	15	2
10	When residuals show increasing spread as x increases, this pattern indicates:	The variance of residuals remains constant across all x-values	The variance of residuals changes across different x-values	The linear relationship becomes stronger at larger x-values	The correlation coefficient approaches positive one steadily	20	2
11	A regression model predicts sales of $45,000 but actual sales were $52,000. This means:	The residual is negative seven thousand dollars in magnitude	The residual is positive seven thousand dollars in magnitude	The model overestimated by seven thousand dollars exactly	The prediction error was forty-five thousand dollars total	15	2
12	The residual plot's x-axis typically displays which of the following:	The calculated residual values from the regression model	The observed values of the response variable from data	The explanatory variable values or predicted response values	The difference between slope and intercept coefficient values	15	3
13	A pattern of residuals that curves down, then up, then down again suggests:	The linear model captures the data's trend extremely well	A polynomial model might provide better fit than linear	The residuals demonstrate perfect random distribution patterns	The correlation coefficient is exactly equal to zero	20	2
14	If every residual in a dataset were negative, this would indicate:	The model consistently overestimates all actual data values	The model consistently underestimates all actual data values	The regression line has a negative slope coefficient value	The correlation between variables is strongly negative throughout	20	1
15	A residual of -8.3 means the actual value was:	Larger than predicted by exactly 8.3 units measured	Smaller than predicted by exactly 8.3 units measured	Equal to negative 8.3 in the original data scale	Undefined because residuals cannot be negative values	15	2
16	Random scatter in a residual plot centered at zero indicates:	The explanatory variable has no relationship with the response	The linear model has captured the systematic pattern successfully	All data points fall exactly on the regression line	The model needs additional explanatory variables immediately added	20	2
17	The equation ŷ = 0.5x + 20 predicts y = 30 when x = 20. If the residual is 5:	The actual y-value equals twenty-five for this observation	The actual y-value equals thirty-five for this observation	The actual x-value equals twenty-five for this observation	The actual x-value equals fifteen for this observation	20	2
18	A fan-shaped pattern in a residual plot (narrow then wide) indicates:	The assumption of constant variance is likely violated here	The linear relationship strengthens as x-values increase gradually	All residuals are positive throughout the entire range	The correlation coefficient equals exactly one at all points	20	1
19	To construct a residual plot, you need to calculate:	Only the correlation coefficient and mean of y-values	Only the slope and intercept of the regression equation	The difference between actual and predicted values for each point	The sum of all squared deviations from the mean	15	3
20	When interpreting a residual of 15.2 in context about organic food items:	The store offers 15.2 more items than the model predicted	The store offers 15.2 fewer items than the model predicted	The store's income is $15,200 above the average income	The correlation between income and items equals 0.152	15	1
21	A residual plot with all points very close to zero suggests:	The linear model fits the data points extremely well overall	The explanatory variable has no predictive power whatsoever	All actual y-values in the dataset equal zero exactly	The regression line has undefined slope and intercept values	15	1
22	If residuals alternate consistently between positive and negative values:	This pattern confirms the model's appropriateness for the data	This pattern suggests possible cyclical behavior in the data	This pattern indicates perfect linear correlation between variables	This pattern means all predictions equal the actual values	20	2
23	The residual for a point on the regression line itself would be:	Equal to the y-value of that particular data point	Equal to the x-value of that particular data point	Exactly zero since predicted equals actual at that point	Undefined because points cannot lie on regression lines	15	3
24	A downward trend in the residual plot indicates that:	The model increasingly overestimates as x-values become larger	The model increasingly underestimates as x-values become larger	The original data shows a negative correlation between variables	The regression line has a positive slope coefficient value	20	1
25	When assessing model fit, patterns in residual plots are important because they:	Determine the exact numerical value of the correlation coefficient	Reveal systematic deviations not captured by the linear model	Calculate the precise values of all regression parameters automatically	Eliminate the need for any additional statistical analysis procedures	20	2
